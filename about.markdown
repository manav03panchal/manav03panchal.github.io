Hey there!

My name's _`Manav`_. I'm a senior at the _`University of Alberta, Canada`_,
where I'm pursuing a _`BSc Specialization in Computing Science`_.

I'm enjoy all things code! From Infrastructure to DevOps to Software Development.

Previously, I worked at **QBoost**, a Laboratory QMC company, as a Database Developer Intern. There, I got my hands dirty building their customizable platform that adapted to each client's unique needs.

> Ruby, HTML, CSS, JS, SQLite

Currently, I'm working at **ATCO Corp.** as a Co-op Student on the **Cloud Tools and Automation** team.

> Ansible, Azure, ServiceNow, Dynatrace

I also really enjoy taking Systems-related courses like _Operating Systems_ and _Computer Networks_, and really interesting and rigorous topics such as _Compiler Design_

> C++, C, Python, LaTeX, ANTLR4

As _VP Marketing_ for the _University of Alberta Investors Club_ `(UAIC)`, I help connect students interested in markets and investing. I manage our outreach, events and social media presence to grow the community of budding investors.

I am a big fan of case competitions, hackathons, and networking events. I love meeting new people and learning about their experiences and passions.
[TBH I love the free food. XD]

Have a good one, aight?
