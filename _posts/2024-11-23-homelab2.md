Hello again!

Continuing on with my homelab, which I am gonna call DecafLab.

Now that I can ssh into it from my laptop, I am gonna *beautify* everything up a little. I'm gonna take advantage of iTerm2 profiles for this. and have this script run every time I ssh, so I see something like this:

![Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/_site/_images/decaflab.png)

Now, this is just when I login from my laptop and for aesthetics, cus why not?
The font I use is Iosevka (the same one on this website), and I use zsh and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh){:target="_blank"} to get autosuggestions.

I am changing the MOTD (Message Of The Day) I see when I log in, I don't wanna see some ads. So here's the steps to get custom ASCII art instead:

1. Install figlet for ASCII art.

    ```bash
      sudo apt install figlet
    ```
2. Write a script. I use [kanye.rest](https://kanye.rest){:target="_blank"} to get a Kanye Quote, and [wttr.in](https://wttr.in){:target="_blank"} for some nice weather info. Something like this:

    ```bash
      #!/bin/bash

      # ASCII
      echo -e "\033[1;30m$(figlet -f slant DecafLab)\033[0m"

      # Ye Quote
      QUOTE=$(curl -s https://api.kanye.rest/ | jq -r '.quote')
      if [ -n "$QUOTE" ]; then
          echo -e "\033[38;5;214m\"$QUOTE\" - Ye\033[0m"
      else
          echo -e "\033[31mCheck Internet Connection...\033[0m"
      fi

      # Border
      echo -e "\033[37m===========================================\033[0m"


      # DateTime
      DATE_TIME=$(TZ="MST7MDT" date +"%A, %d %B %Y | %I:%M:%S %p MST")
      echo -e "\033[1;36m$DATE_TIME\033[0m"

      # wttr.in
      WEATHER=$(curl -s "wttr.in/?format=%C+%t")
      LOCATION=$(curl -s "wttr.in/?format=%l")
      WEATHER_ICON=$(curl -s "wttr.in/?format=%w")

      if [ -n "$WEATHER" ] && [ -n "$LOCATION" ] && [ -n "$WEATHER_ICON" ]; then
          echo -e "\033[1;34m$LOCATION Weather:\033[0m"
          echo -e "\033[1;36m$WEATHER_ICON $WEATHER\033[0m"
      else
          echo -e "\033[31mUnable to fetch weather data.\033[0m"
      fi

      # Border
      echo -e "\033[37m===========================================\033[0m"

    ```
3. Name your script something like `99-decaflab`

    ```bash
      sudo nvim /etc/update-motd.d/99-decaflab
      sudo chmod +x /etc/update-motd.d/99-decaflab
    ```

4. Remove other "non-essential" MOTDs accordingly. And you can now try to ssh into it and check it out.

Great! Now we will get into some *Monitoring* and *Observability* stuff using Prometheus and Grafana, so I can just log into it from my browser on my laptop to see metrics.

Short introduction to Prometheus. Taken straight from their website :)
>| Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels. It is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit.

Let's set this up on my machine. I am following the docs (as one should.)

[Download.](https://prometheus.io/download/){:target="_blank"} Or use `wget` cus we are running this brother headless.

```bash
  wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/latest/download/prometheus-3.0.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
  tar -xvzf prometheus-3.0.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
  cd prometheus-3.0.1
```

Now, if I run this `./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml`\
and hit `http://<homelab-ip>:9090` I will see a dashboard. \
Noice.

Now, we install [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter){:target="_blank"}, which exposes system stats like CPU, memory, and disk.

```bash
  wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/latest/download/node_exporter-1.8.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
  tar -xvzf node_exporter-1.8.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Now if I run `./node_exporter`\
I will see a dashboard at `http://<homelab-ip>:9100`\
W.

Now we can edit the `prometheus.yml` to include this as target.
```yml
# inside scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "node_exporter"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9100"]
```

To be continued...
